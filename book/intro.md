# Foundations of Neural and Cognitive Modelling

This website contains the lab assignments for the course "Foundations of Neural and Cognitive Modelling" at the University of Amsterdam, taught by [Jelle (aka Willem) Zuidema](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/w.zuidema/) and team. These notebooks are the result of the combined work of Iris Proff, [Marianne de Heer Kloots](http://mdhk.net/), and Simone Astarita, and can be used as an approachable introduction to models of the brain and the mind.

You can access the assignments through the menu on the left. To open a lab assignment in Google Colab, go to the assignment page and hover your mouse over the rocket symbol (<img alt="rocket" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/rocket.svg" width="18" height="18">) in the top right, then choose _Colab_.
