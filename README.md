The lab assignments and the associated website for the course "Foundations of Neural and Cognitive Modelling" at the University of Amsterdam (Semester 1, Period 2, Year 2022), taught by professor Jelle (aka Willem) Zuidema with the support of teaching assistant Simone Astarita. These notebooks are the result of the combined work of Iris Proff, Marianne de Heer Kloots, and Simone Astarita, and can be used as an approachable introduction to models of the brain and the mind.
