# FNCM

The lab assignments and the associated website for the course "Foundations of Neural and Cognitive Modelling" at the University of Amsterdam, taught by [Jelle (aka Willem) Zuidema](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/w.zuidema/) and team. These notebooks are the result of the combined work of Iris Proff, [Marianne de Heer Kloots](http://mdhk.net/), and Simone Astarita, and can be used as an approachable introduction to models of the brain and the mind.
